The Library Management System is a simple Python program designed to manage a collection of books efficiently. It allows users to perform basic operations such as adding new books to the collection, removing books, and viewing the current list of books. The program is menu-driven, providing an interactive interface where users can select options to perform desired actions. By storing book titles in a list, it ensures easy manipulation and retrieval of data. This project serves as an excellent introduction to managing dynamic data in Python and understanding user interaction in command-line applications.
